## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The
page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section
about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the
build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be
deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!** This command will remove the single build
dependency from your project, copying all the configuration files and dependencies into your project so you have full
control over them.
